## Git 

To initialize the git we should use the command below,

```sh
git init
```

## Cloning
    We have three ways to clone the Repo namely HTTPS, SSH, GitHub CLI

Since we are using the Codespaces we will create a temp directory in our workspace

``` sh
mkdir workspaces/temp
cd workspaces/temp
```


```sh
git clone https://github.com/SK-Codespace/GitHub_Examples.git
```

## HTTPS

## Commit

## Merge

## Branches

## Remotes

## Stashing
